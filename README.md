# Excuse

My crappy old codes I wrote when I was a student, which somehow represents my weird obsession into Haskell.

# Notes

Things might be interesting:

- Repmin.hs: replace every nodes in binary tree with minimum value by traversing tree _only once_ (utilizing lazy evaluation)
- ChurchNumeral.hs: represent _church number_ in Haskell's type system by using Rank-2 polymorphism (System F's large lambda)
- ListLike.hs: _O(1)-append_ list like structure
- nondet-parallel.hs: define list monad join based on [Cartesian Product of Countable Sets is Countable](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Cartesian_Product_of_Countable_Sets_is_Countable) argument, so that infinite lists can join "nicely"
- others/PR.hs: represent _primitive recursive_ functions in Haskell
- MyLang/: interpreter for ML-like language with lazy evaluation
